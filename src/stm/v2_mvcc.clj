;; version 2 - multi-version concurrency control STM with history lists
;; Improvements over v1:
;; - internal consistency is now guaranteed, thanks to MVCC
;;   (storing multiple historical values per mc-ref)
;;
;; Limitations:
;; - a single global commit-lock for all transactions
;;   (= severe bottleneck, but makes it easy to validate and commit)
;; - naive support for commute
;; - naive support for ensure (to prevent write skew)
